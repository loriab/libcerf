Build&install are based on CMake.
Out-of-source build is enforced.

== Standard build ==

After unpacking the source, go to the source directory and do:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install

== Compile as C++ code ==

By default, the sources of libcerf are compiled as C code.
Alternatively, they can be compiled as C++. This is useful
under MS VisualStudio, which supports C++14, but not yet C99,
and in particular does not support complex.h under C.

To choose C++ compilation, do

cmake -DCERF_CPP=ON ..

In this case, the C++ code that calls functions from libcerf
must be compiled with the option -DCERF_AS_CPP.

== Uninstall ==

CMake does not produce a 'make uninstall' target.
Instead, use the list of installed files in the
build directory:

cat install_manifest.txt | xargs rm
